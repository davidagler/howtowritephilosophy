## Section 1. Quote from a Book

Here is a quote: "There seems to be no conceptual absurdity in supposing that this is *always* the case: it is conceptually possible that, for every person, there is a moment such that he will die at that moment and such that his death at that moment is weakly inevitable for him if it is not strongly inevitable. But we cannot take seriously any suggestion that this conceptual possibility is in fact realized. If it were realized, this would either be simply an enormous, meaningless multiple accident, an accident of more than astronomical improbability, or else the result of the manipulations of some cosmic "puppet-master" like Death or Death's employers in Maugham's play."

This quote is from p.27 of a book by Peter van Inwagen. The book was published in 1983, is titled *An Essay on Free Will*, was published in Oxford by Oxford University Press.

## Section 2. Quote from a Journal Article

Here is a quote from a journal article: "It is sometimes said that the world might itself *be* vague. Rather than vagueness being a deficiency in our mode of describing the world, it would then be a necessary feature of any true description of it. It is also said that amongst the statements which may not have a determinate truth value as a result of their vagueness are identity statements. Combining these two views we would arrive at the idea that the world might contain certain objects about which it is a *fact* that they have fuzzy boundaries. But is this idea coherent?"

The quote is from p.208 of a journal. The article is titled "Can There Be Vague Objects?". It was published in 1978 in a journal titled *Analysis*. Volume Number 38, Issue Number 4. The article is one page long: p.208.
