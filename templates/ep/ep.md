## Paper topic - Described

In this paper, I will argue that X is the case. In section 2, I will explain problem / concept / theory Y. After explaining this problem, in section 3, I will provide an argument that X is the case. Finally, in section 4, I will summarize my results and point to limitations and areas where further research is needed.

## List of pages

The primary source to be used in writing this paper is Quine, W. V. 1952. “The Problem of Simplifying Truth Functions.” *The American Mathematical Monthly* 59 (8): 521–31.

I will focus my attention on the first 5 pages of this paper.

## Quotation from primary source

Quine says that reducing a formula to its simplest equivalent formula is easy. He writes

> "Given any formula, we can, in principle, survey the totality of simpler formulas involving no additional letters; for this totality is finite. By truth tables or otherwise, we can test each of these simpler formulas for equivalence to the given formula, and thus pick out the simplest equivalent" (Quine 1952:522).
