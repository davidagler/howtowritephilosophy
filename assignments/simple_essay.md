# Simple Essay

Let's write a simple philosophy essay. In this paper, you will (1) introduce a philosophical idea or theory, (2) clarify / explain that idea or theory, and then (3) argue for that idea or theory. The two primary goals in writing this type of essay are (1) developing your ability to clarify philosophical ideas and (2) arguing for a philosophical position in a clearer and more systematic way.

Let's start the paper by either (1) downloading the [simple essay](https://github.com/davidagler/howtowritephilosophy/tree/main/templates) from the templates folder or (2) writing items found in most papers:

1. Your name, class name, a paper title, and word count should be included at the top of the paper
1. A paper consisting of four sections (explicitly label and title each of these sections).
1. A reference section where you will put your reference citations

Next, let's divide your paper into **four** sections. You should label each of these sections.

*Section 1* should be an introduction where you do each of the following: (1) give a brief summary of the plan of your paper where you state what each section of your paper will accomplish, (2) a single-line statement of your position (your thesis) on this particular topic. This section is introductory; you are simply preparing your reader for what is to come and so be brief but clear.

*Section 2* is your clarification section. Here is where you supply context and articulate key ideas that are necessary for understanding the idea or theory you plan on arguing for. In this section, you would want to supply the reader with what they need to know about the topic you are writing about. Some examples:

- If you are writing about the ethics of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDS) in sports, you want to state what is or is not a PED, give an example of an athlete using a PED, define any key moral terms, or explain the relevant moral positions on the topic
- If you are writing about whether human beings are free or if all of their actions are fated, then you want to define what it means to be "free" or for an action to be "fated", along with the relevant theories or debates you plan on discussing in your paper.

In this section, you must (1) quote and explain at least one line of the reading (including an appropriate in-text and reference citation) and (2) use of an example that illustrates the topic you are discussing.

*Section 3* should be your argumentative section where you provide an argument that explicitly states whether you agree or disagree with the idea or theory you have clarified in *Section 2* and you must give reasons in support for your position. In arguing for your position, you should express your argument in argument standard form ([What is Argument Standard Form?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVpOMUav_uE)), \emph{explain} each of the premises of the argument, and then support the premises of your argument (state why they are true). 

To illustrate, suppose you put forward your argument like this:

```
- P1: Premise 1
- P2: Premise 2
- C: Conclusion
```

You would then clarify and support each of these premises. Be sure to distinguish when you are *explaining what the premise says* and when you are *supplying reasons for why the premise is true*. Here is an example:

> P1 says A. This premise is true because of C. P2 says B. This premise is true because of D.



In putting forward your argument, here are some tips:

 - Tip 1. Consider thinking about what one theory can do but another cannot. You can argue that one theory is better than another in some respect rather than all-things-considered.
 - Tip 2. You are stating whether the claim is true or false, not whether it is true for you (or whether you believe it). You don’t need to justify (prove) your own belief, you need to persuade an impartial reader whether your view on the matter is right or wrong.
 - Tip 3. Write your argument with the following audience in mind: someone who is intelligent, who is pretty different from you in terms of their beliefs, and who would likely disagree with what you are saying.
 - Tip 4. Be explicit about the reasons that support your position. It helps to signal them with [metadiscourse](../lessons/metadiscourse): “There are two reasons for why theory X is true. First, Y. Second Z.”

Finally, *Section 4* should be a conclusion where you (in a few lines) briefly summarize the contents of your paper. You can do this in a few lines. You can also indicate any caveats you have or areas that require further research.

## Basic Rubric

- 10pts - Paper Details (name, title, word count, paper sections, and reference citations)
- 10pts - Section 1 contains clear summary of plan of paper, single-line thesis statement
- 35pts - Section 2 defines important terms, clarifies key ideas and theories, illustrates ideas with an example, quotes and explains one passage from course reading
- 35pts - Section 3 supplies argument for the thesis in standard form, explains each premise, defends each premise effectively.
- 10pts - Section 4 summarize the paper.
