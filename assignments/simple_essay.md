# Simple Essay

Let's write a simple philosophy essay. In this paper, you will (1) introduce a philosophical topic, (2) clarify a philosophical theory or concept, and then (3) evaluate the theory or concept. The two primary goals in writing this type of essay are (1) developing your ability to clarify philosophical ideas and (2) arguing for a philosophical position in a clearer and more systematic way.

Let's start the paper by either (1) downloading the [simple essay](https://github.com/davidagler/howtowritephilosophy/tree/main/templates) from the templates folder or (2) writing items found in most papers:

1. Your name, class name, a paper title, and word count should be included at the top of the paper
1. A paper consisting of four sections (explicitly label and title each of these sections).
1. A reference section where you will put your reference citations

Next, let's divide your paper into **four** sections. You should label each of these sections.

*Section 1* should be an introduction where you do each of the following: (1) give a brief summary of the plan of your paper where you state what each section of your paper will accomplish, (2) a single-line statement of your position (your thesis) on this particular topic. This section is introductory; you are simply preparing your reader for what is to come and so be brief but clear.

*Section 2* should be your clarification section. Here is where you articulate key ideas, theories, terms or arguments that are necessary for understanding each of the theories you plan on comparing. Your goal here is to make each of the theories more understandable. In this section, you must (1) quote and explain at least one line of the reading (including an appropriate in-text and reference citation) and (2)  use of an example that illustrates the topic you are discussing (e.g. if you are discussing whether sport rules against PEDs are acceptable, you might cite a case where an individual was caught).

*Section 3* should be your argumentative section where you provide an argument that explicitly states whether you agree or disagree with the idea you have explored and the reasons for your position. In arguing for your position, you should express your argument in argument standard form ([What is Argument Standard Form?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVpOMUav_uE)), explain each of the premises of the argument, and then support that argument with reasons.

In putting forward your argument, here are some tips:

 - Tip 1. Consider thinking about what one theory can do but another cannot. You can argue that one theory is better than another in some respect rather than all-things-considered.
 - Tip 2. You are stating whether the claim is true or false, not whether it is true for you (or whether you believe it). You don’t need to justify (prove) your own belief, you need to persuade an impartial reader whether your view on the matter is right or wrong.
 - Tip 3. Write your argument with the following audience in mind: someone who is intelligent, who is pretty different from you in terms of their beliefs, and who would likely disagree with what you are saying.
 - Tip 4. Be explicit about the reasons that support your position. It helps to signal them with the following phrases: “There are two reasons for why theory X is true. First, Y. Second Z.”

Finally, *Section 4* should be a conclusion where you (in a few lines) briefly summarize the contents of your paper. You can do this in a few lines. You can also indicate any caveats you have or areas that require further research.
