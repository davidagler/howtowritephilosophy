# Using Templates

Many people write their papers in a chronological manner. They start with the first sentence and stop their papers on the last sentence. A better approach is to divide your paper into sections where each section has a specific task. With this in mind, let's consider an unwritten paper has the following structure:

1. Introduction
2. Analysis / Clarification of a Problem
3. Previous Solutions to a Problem
4. My Great Solution to a Problem
5. Conclusion

With this structure in mind, we can start working on the different sections in a more directed fashion. For example, it probably makes the most sense to start with Section 2. We want to get clear about the problem (or debate) we plan on solving. This clarification will inform how we go about what information is required in sections 3 and 4. While we are reading texts and writing about texts that explain the problem, we might come across possible solutions to the problem. When we come across those solutions, we should do some writing for Section 3. If we have any interesting ideas while reading about these problems, we should write them in Section 4. Once we have completed Sections 2-4, we can then write Sections 1 and 5.

In other words, before writing a paper, it is helpful to have a basic template that allows you to organize the main goals, sections, or ideas of your paper. Let's consider a more fleshed out template below

## Sample Template

Class or Assignment Name<br>
Date Submitted<br>

*Paper Title*

*Section 1. Introduction*

> Explain the topic of your paper, note your principal goals/aims/theses, and state the structure of your paper. In section 2, I will do X. In section 3, I will do Y. In section 4, I will do Z.

*Section 2. Analysis of a problem*

> Begin by indicating what this section plans to do. In this section, we will analyze a problem or a debate. Introduce the relevant terms, concepts, ideas, history, or positions. 

*Section 3. A previous solution*

> Again, begin by indicating what this section plans to do. Now that the problem or debate has been clarified, explain a previous attempt at solving this problem. 

*Section 4. A better solution*

> Again! Begin by indicating what this section plans to do. In this section, you will state a different solution and why this solution (1) solves the problem (settles the debate) or (2) is better than previous solutions. In addition, you could state some limitations of this solution.

*Section 5 Conclusion*

> Summarize the paper.

*References*
