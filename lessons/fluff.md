# Removing Fluff

A general guide to composition is to "be concise". What does that mean? We can be more concise in two ways:

1. omit any words or phrases while preserving our meaning
1. rewrite sentences while preserving our meaning

With respect to (1), William Shrunk Jr. (1918) says to "omit needless words": 

> "A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts." (p.21)

Let's consider a few examples of sentences with "needless words". First, compare the following sentences:

1. Her story is *a* strange *one*.
1. Her story is strange.

The words "a" and "one" can be removed without loss of meaning. Or, Shrunk Jr. points out that we can eliminate *of the fact* from sentences:

1. Tek was unaware *of the fact* that the earth was flat.
1. Tek was unaware that the earth was flat.

Next, Shrunk Jr. says that some ways of expressing ideas tend to be more concise than others. For example, authors often tell their readers *what is not the case*. For instance, Jon may tell Liz the following:

> "Tek is not to be trusted".

However, it is usually more concise and more desirable to say *what is the case*. Jon could simply say the following:

> "Tek is untrustworthy."

So, rather than saying "not honest", write "dishonest". Rather than "did not remember", use "forgot". Here are a few more examples:

1. not important -> unimportant / trifling
1. did not pay attention to / ignored
1. did not have confidence in / distrusted
1. Tek is not to be trusted / Tek is untrustworthy.

In short, we can be more concise by saying what is the case than what is not the case.

## Philosophical Fluff

Let's pick out one piece of philosophical fluff often found in philosophical essays. Beginning writers are often uncertain about their claims and so they use language to express that uncertainty. Let's consider an example. Suppose Tek is tasked with arguing that theory T is true. He provides several arguments that theory T is true. However, he concludes his paper as follows:

> "Therefore, from my point of view, theory T seems like it is true."

There are two pieces of "fluff" in this sentence. The first is that it is irrelevant for Tek to say that theory T is true "from my point of view". It is irrelevant because the truth of the theory and the reasons presumably are independent on the author's point of view. Tek's sentence can thus be shortened as follows:

> "Therefore, ~~from my point of view,~~ theory T seems like it is true."

The second piece of fluff is the use of "seems". Tek was tasked with arguing for showing that "theory T is true" not with "theory T seeming to be true". 


> "Therefore, ~~from my point of view,~~ theory T ~~seems like it~~ is true."

This sentence can be made more concise if we rewrite it as follows:

> "Therefore, theory T is true."
