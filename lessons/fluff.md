# Removing Fluff

A general guide to composition is to "be concise". What does that mean? We can be more concise in two ways:

1. omit any words or phrases while preserving our meaning
1. rewrite sentences while preserving our meaning

# Omitting Words

With respect to (1), Alexander Bain wrote that if we are following the principle of "attaining ends at the smallest costs, it is a virtue of language to be brief" (p.27). More concisely, William Shrunk Jr. (1918) says to "omit needless words": 

> "A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts." (p.21)

Let's consider a few examples of sentences with "needless words". Consider the following sentence:

> "Her story is a strange one."

This sentence is concise but we can make it more concise by eliminating two words. Can you see which ones?

> "Her story is ~~a~~ strange ~~one~~."

Another example from Shrunk Jr. is that we can eliminate * the fact* from sentences:

1. Tek was unaware ~~of the fact~~ that the earth is a sphere.
1. Tek didn't know ~~the fact~~ that the earth is a sphere.

Here is a third example. Bain writes that we sometimes use *two* words where *one* will do. That is, we can eliminate the other word when it is practically equivalent to the other, or when the difference of meaning between the two is not important. Here is an example:

> "it was the *privilege* and *birthright* of every *citizen* and *poet*, to rail *aloud* and *in public*."

Such a sentence might be simplified as follows:

> "it was the *privilege* of every *citizen* to rail *in public*."

Some other examples:

1. Tek's mind is the sharpest and keenest
1. Tek's plan was pure and simple
1. The politician provokes and incites
1. The idea fades and vanishes
1. I was stocked and astonished to hear

# Rewriting sentences

In order to be brief, it is necessary not that words are removed but that the sentence (or portions of the sentence) is rewritten. Consider the following obvious examples:

1. Single words may be substituted for phrases
1. Long phrases may be substituted with shorter ones

Let's consider some less obvious examples. Authors often tell their readers *what is not the case*. For instance, Jon may tell Liz the following:

> "Tek is not to be trusted".

However, it is usually more concise and more desirable to say *what is the case*. Jon could simply say the following:

> "Tek is untrustworthy."

So, rather than saying "not honest", write "dishonest". Rather than "did not remember", use "forgot". Here are a few more examples:

1. not important -> unimportant / trifling
1. did not pay attention to / ignored
1. did not have confidence in / distrusted
1. Tek is not to be trusted / Tek is untrustworthy.

In short, we can be more concise by saying what is the case than what is not the case.

## Philosophical Fluff

Let's pick out one piece of philosophical fluff often found in philosophical essays. Beginning writers are often uncertain about their claims and so they use language to express that uncertainty. Let's consider an example. Suppose Tek is tasked with arguing that theory T is true. He provides several arguments that theory T is true. However, he concludes his paper as follows:

> "Therefore, from my point of view, theory T seems like it is true."

There are two pieces of "fluff" in this sentence. The first is that it is irrelevant for Tek to say that theory T is true "from my point of view". It is irrelevant because the truth of the theory and the reasons presumably are independent on the author's point of view. Tek's sentence can thus be shortened as follows:

> "Therefore, ~~from my point of view,~~ theory T seems like it is true."

The second piece of fluff is the use of "seems". Tek was tasked with arguing for showing that "theory T is true" not with "theory T seeming to be true". 

> "Therefore, ~~from my point of view,~~ theory T ~~seems like it~~ is true."
