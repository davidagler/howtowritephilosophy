# A Checklist for the Developmental Essay

## Basic Stuff

1. Is the paper about an acceptable topic (e.g., time)?
2. Is it over word limit (e.g. 2000 words)?
3. Does it contain at least 5 **scholarly** sources? Not just websites or blog articles.
4. Does it contain at least 5 sections?
5. Did they use the template? Not required but highly suggested.
6. Does it contain their name, class name, a paper title, and word count
7. Does it contain five, explicitly labeled sections?
8. Does it contain a reference page and in-text citations?
9. Does it contain at least one passage of text that is quoted and explained.

## More substantial stuff

1. Does section 1 introduce the central topic, thesis, and structure of the paper?
2. Does section 2 clarify the topic in detail, e.g., explaining jargon, illustrating concepts with concrete examples, and both quote and explain a passage of text?
3. Does section 3 provide an argument in argument standard form? And, does it explain the premises of this argument?
4. Does section 4 explicitly respond to any criticisms made to the argument provided in section 5?
5. Does section 5 summarize the content of the essay, limit the scope of the essay, and / or point to any key areas where future research is required?
